    <rich_text background="#9a9996" foreground="#c64600" weight="heavy">What is Log4j?</rich_text>
    <rich_text>
	Log4j is a </rich_text>
    <rich_text foreground="#ed333b">tool used</rich_text>
    <rich_text> in Java programming </rich_text>
    <rich_text foreground="#ed333b">to record log messages</rich_text>
    <rich_text>. These </rich_text>
    <rich_text foreground="#ed333b">messages</rich_text>
    <rich_text> help track what an application is doing, making it </rich_text>
    <rich_text foreground="#ed333b">easier to find and fix problems</rich_text>
    <rich_text>.
	
why it is important?
	•   DEBUG</rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">ging</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Helps find errors in the code.
	• </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Monitoring</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Keeps an eye on application performance.
	• </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Maintenance</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Makes it easier to maintain the application by understanding its behavior.
	• </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Security</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Logs can help detect unauthorized activities.

How to implement?
	• </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Add Log4j Library</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Include Log4j in your project, typically using a dependency manager like Maven or Gradle.
	• </rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Configure Log4j</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Create a configuration file (like log4j.properties or log4j.xml) to specify how and where to log messages.
	</rich_text>
    <rich_text weight="heavy">Write Log Messages</rich_text>
    <rich_text>: Use Log4j in your code to log messages. For example
		import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

	public class MyApp {
		private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyApp.class);

		public static void main(String[] args) {
		    logger.info("Application started");
		    // Your code here
		    logger.error("An error occurred");
		}
	}


How does it works?
	Log4j </rich_text>
    <rich_text foreground="#ed333b">captures log messages</rich_text>
    <rich_text> from your application and sends them to different destinations like the </rich_text>
    <rich_text foreground="#ed333b">console, files, or databases</rich_text>
    <rich_text>. It uses a configuration file to know what messages to capture and where to send them.
